# Gastro 360 – Restaurant Analytics Tool (Paris)

## 📊 Summary

**Gastro 360** is an analytics tool designed for **restaurant owners and operations managers in Paris**. This project is part of the Group Project during our Data Analytics Bootcamp at Le Wagon, held from November 2024 - February 2025. Our goal is to help business partners scale their operations, increase revenue streams, and optimize workflows using insightful data dashboards developed in Power BI.

This project addresses a key gap in the Tiller by SumUp ecosystem—while Tiller provides a powerful POS system, it lacks a robust analytics solution. Our tool leverages Tiller’s dataset to provide actionable insights for business growth.
